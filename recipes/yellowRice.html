    <h3>Fragrant turmeric and saffron rice cooked with chicken and some peas to add texture and color, and all in one pot for more flavor and less cleanup. The perfect one-pot chicken meal.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Chicken with yellow rice also known as Arroz con Pollo is a classic recipe from Spain and Latin America. This is my Arabic version of the recipe inspired by my mom. We love anything and everything yellow rice and this one is a complete meal by itself. Have some salad on the side and dinner is served.</p>
